# SAFE REMOTE PURCHASE

Transaction executed by agreed terms between buyer and seller, in this case the buyer and seller escrow an amount within the smart contract so that when the purchase is completed (when the goods are received in the real world etc..) then the escrowed amounts are sent to the respective parties.

An abort method in the contract can be invoked when the contract is created, if the seller does not want to carry on with the transaction, wherein the funds of the contract ie. those escrowed by the seller are returned and the contract made inactive.
